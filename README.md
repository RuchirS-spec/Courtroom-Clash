# ‚öñÔ∏è Courtroom Clash: An AI Legal Simulator

**Simulate a chaotic courtroom battle between a meticulous prosecutor and an unpredictable defense lawyer using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models.**

This project uses **Langflow** to create and visualize a complex agent-based system where AI personas argue a court case provided by the user. The case facts are stored and retrieved from a vector database powered by **Astra DB**, ensuring all arguments are grounded in the provided evidence.
